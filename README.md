# advent-of-code-2024

Let's try at least day 1 of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I want to use Nushell but for contrast
I'm also doing a basic "loops and maps" based implementation using Java. 


## Instructions

Run a Nushell solution with the example input:  

```nushell
nu day-1-part-1.nu --example
```

Run a Nushell solution with the full input:

```nushell
nu day-1-part-1.nu
```

Run a Java solution with the example input:

```nushell
EXAMPLE=true java --source 21 --enable-preview day_1_part_1.java
```

Run a Java solution with the full input:

```nushell
java --source 21 --enable-preview day_1_part_1.java
